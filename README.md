# Cuis-Smalltalk-Vim

This is a package for Cuis Smalltalk that adds support for a subset of Vim
in add editable text areas.

Initially this will only support the Vim keystrokes that I use most often.
If it is missing support for Vim keystrokes that you use,
please let me know by creating an issue and I will consider adding it.
